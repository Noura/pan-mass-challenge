<div class="my-title">Nick's Ride</div>
<p>
    For my Uncle Tim, who left the world as a teenager, who I identify with every single day and never got a chance to meet. For my grandfather who taught me to throw the meanest curveball, and gave me meaningful life advice that I also use every day. For my mother in law and father in law who beat it with all of their strength and perseverance. For my mom's mother who lost her struggle. For all of you and your families, loved ones, our future and the world... I ride.

<p>
    I need your help to fulfill the dream of ending cancer.  I need your support to raise my goal of $5,000 for the Pan Mass Challenge.
